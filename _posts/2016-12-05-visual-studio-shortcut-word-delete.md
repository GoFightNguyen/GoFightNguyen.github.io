Word Delete to End: Ctrl + Del

Word Delete to Start: Ctrl + Backspace

To delete a word or small set of consecutive words, I [extend selection]({{"/blog/visual-studio-shortcut-extend-selection"}}) and then delete it. Although efficient, this requires 1 more key press than using the __word delete__ keyboard shortcuts. So, unless the code to delete spans multiple lines, I will use these Visual Studio shortcuts.
