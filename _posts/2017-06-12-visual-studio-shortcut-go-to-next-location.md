Go To Next Location: F8

Go To Previous Location: Shift + F8

These shortcuts move the cursor to the next/previous item in a window. Subsequent invocations will move to the next/previous item in the list. Some examples are:
  * a task in the Task List window
  * a search match in the Find Results window
  * an error in the Error List window
  * a reference in the [Find All References]({{"/blog/visual-studio-shortcut-find-all-references"}}) window
