Find Next Selected: Ctrl + F3

Find Previous Selected: Ctrl + Shift + F3

The previous two posts taught us about [Quick Find]({{"/blog/visual-studio-shortcut-quick-find"}}) and to follow it with [Find Next/Previous]. While utilizing these I realized I sometimes want to find the next/previous instance of the current text; the __Find Next Selected__ shortcut does just that. After invoking it for the first time, one can then use [Find Next/Previous].
