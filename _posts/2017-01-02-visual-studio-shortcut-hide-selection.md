Hide Selection: Ctrl + M, Ctrl + H

Next time you want to hide some code, like in a long or convoluted method, try using this shortcut.

In the example, notice the selected code is not a distinct member of the outline initially. After using __hide selection__, it is; thus, it can be affected by the Visual Studio shortcuts for outlining such as [toggle outlining expansion]({{"/blog/visual-studio-shortcut-toggle-outlining-expansion"}}).
