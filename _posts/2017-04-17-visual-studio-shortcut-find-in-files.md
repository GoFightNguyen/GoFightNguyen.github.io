Find in Files: Ctrl + Shift + F

__Find in Files__ is nearly the same as [Quick Find], but it:
  * can include external files in it's search
  * performs a Find All by default, which displays the results in one of the Find Results windows
  
  So how do we decide which to use? If I want to do a Find Next in the current document, then I use [Quick Find]. When I want to do a Find All or search more than the current document, then I use __Find in Files__.
