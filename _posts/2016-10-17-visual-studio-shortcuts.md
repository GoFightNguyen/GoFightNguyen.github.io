When I started my career, I did not know about keyboard shortcuts. 
I thought the only way to copy/paste was to right-click or use the Edit menu. 
Imagine my astonishment when I saw a coworker copy/paste without leaving the keyboard? 
That is when I realized my inefficiency with my software tools.

### Why blog about Visual Studio shortcuts?

I spend a lot of time in Visual Studio; I assume you do too. 
Despite the thousands of hours spent there, I do not know the hotkeys for many of the most common operations.
