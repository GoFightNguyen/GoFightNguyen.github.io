When I started my career, I did not know about keyboard shortcuts. 
I thought the only way to copy/paste was to right-click or use the Edit menu. 
Imagine my astonishment when I saw a coworker copy/paste without leaving the keyboard? 
That is when I realized my inefficiency with my software tools.

### Why blog about Visual Studio shortcuts?

I spend a lot of time in Visual Studio; I assume you do too. 
Despite the thousands of hours spent there, I do not know the hotkeys for many of the most common operations. 
By learning some of them, I hope to: 

* spend more time focusing on the problems being solved
* increase efficiency in Visual Studio
* be a better partner when pairing

From blogs/tweets and time spent with others, I realized others are like me. 
Thus, I want to share this knowledge and experience with you.

### The learning process
I will post one Visual Studio keyboard shortcut around the beginning of each week. 
For the duration of that week, I will force myself to use it every time possible. 
Through an informal experiment on myself, I found this approach to be effective.
I think it can work for you too. 
You can follow along on [twitter] and your favorite aggregator.
