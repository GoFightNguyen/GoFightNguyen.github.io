Move Selected Lines Up: Alt + Up Arrow  
Move Selected Lines Down: Alt + Down Arrow

These Visual Studio shortcuts can be used to move the current line or a block of code. When moving code a short distance, usually within view, I prefer these shortcuts over cutting, moving to the desired location, and then pasting.
