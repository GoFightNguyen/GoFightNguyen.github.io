List Members: Ctrl + K, L

How do you display the members (constants, fields, properties, methods) of a type or namespace? If you are typing new code, then Visual Studio does it for you automatically after you insert a trigger character (a period (.) in managed code). But what if the code already exists? Normally, I insert another trigger character and then delete it.

Using this Visual Studio keyboard shortcut, we can list members by simply executing the command after the existing trigger character.
