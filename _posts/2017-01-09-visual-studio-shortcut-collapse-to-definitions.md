Collapse to Definitions: Ctrl + M, Ctrl + O

When I open a class with numerous methods and/or properties, I collapse every one of them. Why?
1. If I am unfamiliar with a class, then I prefer to start at a higher-level of abstraction and not see the implementations yet.
2. If I am familiar with a class, then I only want to see what is relevant to the current problem.

With this Visual Studio shortcut, I no longer have to do the collapsing one method/property at a time.
