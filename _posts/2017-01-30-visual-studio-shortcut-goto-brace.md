Goto Brace: Ctrl + ]

I was recently working in a for loop over 200 lines long; it contained a plethora of if/else statements, switch statements, and other loops. At one point, the nesting reached level 4. _Navigating and reading this code was great_.

One benefit produced by this endeavor was discovering this Visual Studio shortcut. Goto Brace navigates from an opening curly brace to its corresponding closing curly brace and vice versa.
