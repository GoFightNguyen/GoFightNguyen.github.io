Here's how to reach me on various communication channels

Thanks for wanting to get in touch with me! 
This page lists the channels I use and how I like to use them. 
I'll usually respond to all legitimate communications.

**Twitter**: [Go_Fight_Nguyen][1]

This is my primary means of broadcasting things to the world so please follow me there. 
I do read my DMs and allow them from people I don't follow.

**LinkedIn**: [jasonsnguyen][2]

My background is decently well covered here. 
I accept connections from people I've met, worked with, spoken with or otherwise had enough 
interaction to feel that I can call them a professional contact. 
I don't respond to requests from people I don't know.
